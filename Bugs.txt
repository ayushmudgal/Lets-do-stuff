bugs:
- The friend button styling inconsistencies - {fixed mostly - VL}

NEW:
- AND AUTO-SCROLL: http://stackoverflow.com/a/21067431
- The profile table is not centered when u try to shrink the page
- On user's profile, the edit button should locate at top right and the message button should locate under user's avatar
- Modify the css of input box in the chat room so it can auto expand when the text size is larger then the default text size - {This is not CSS. This is done with fancy javascript/jquery. will try later - VL}
- The chat history is not scrolling for me
- In the profile page, the stats update should not be a button link to the current page
- Change the "create a new room" link to a plus sign image button
- Don't allow people to edit other people's profiles

Possible new features:
- see when friend has last logged in
- see whether friend is online (track login/logout)
- enable only one account per IP so no trolling
- enable people to grant admin access to other users if you are an admin
- admin is not permitted to leave room until another user has been admined.
