bugs:

NEW:
- AUTO-SCROLL chat: http://stackoverflow.com/a/21067431
- Modify the css of input box in the chat room so it can auto expand when the text size is larger then the default text size - {This is not CSS. This is done with fancy javascript/jquery. will try later - VL}
- In the profile page, the stats update should not be a button link to the current page
- css of edit destroy
- add a link to the sidebar to browse categories
- add an accordion to the sidebar of the list of rooms you've joined for easy access

Possible new features:
- see whether friend is online (track login/logout)
- enable only one account per IP so no trolling
- enable people to grant admin access to other users if you are an admin
- admin is not permitted to leave room until another user has been admined.
- message other users directly
