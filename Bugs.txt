bugs:

- The friend button styling inconsistencies

NEW:
- time should preferably be in your zip code's time zone, not in UTC. Maybe you can set your time zone from your user profile or have it autoloaded after you put down your time zone.
- AND AUTO-SCROLL: http://stackoverflow.com/a/21067431
- Delete button (for deleting each room) is not working
