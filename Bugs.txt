bugs:

- When I sign in, it tells me I'm signed in one page too late - I get it when I'm on Browse Rooms rather than the Home page
- The description of a just-edited room (possibly all rooms) has a date. The time is also wrong - it says 1/1/2000 instead of today's date, which is in description.
- The friend button styling inconsistencies
- Change back button into an image button with a small arrow ( the class for back button is class="nav1" U can search for key words to find where are they)
